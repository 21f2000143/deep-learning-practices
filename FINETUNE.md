Thanks for sharing your setup. You're already using a solid base for fine-tuning Gemma-3-1B-it on emotion classification with LoRA. To improve performance further, especially for low-resource or complex emotion tasks, consider the following **strategic upgrades** across key areas:

---

## ‚úÖ 1. **Refine LoRA Configuration**

Your current config:

```python
target_modules="all-linear"
```

This may adapt too many layers indiscriminately. For **task-specific efficiency and better generalization**, try more **focused target modules**, like:

```python
target_modules=["q_proj", "v_proj", "o_proj", "gate_proj"]
```

Why?

* These layers are crucial for attention and MLP computations.
* Including `gate_proj` can help learn fine emotional nuances.

Also test:

* Lower `r` values like `r=16` or `32` to avoid overfitting (especially on smaller datasets).
* Use `fan_in_fan_out=True` if the model uses transposed weights (verify with model internals).

---

## ‚úÖ 2. **Instruction Template Quality**

Emotion classification benefits greatly from **prompt clarity** and **example richness**.

Improve your prompt structure:

```text
Instruction: Classify the emotion in the following text. 
Choose from: happy, sad, anger, fear, disgust, surprise.

Text: {sentence}

Answer:
```

Then expect the model to output the **label only** (`"happy"`, `"sad"` etc.).

üîÅ Use `add_special_tokens=True` during tokenization to help with structured prompt understanding.

---

## ‚úÖ 3. **Batching and Accumulation**

Your effective batch size is:

```python
batch_size = 1 * 8 = 8
```

üëâ **Try increasing batch size** if memory allows (e.g., `per_device_train_batch_size=2`), or increase `gradient_accumulation_steps` to 16.

This stabilizes training and helps generalization on classification tasks.

---

## ‚úÖ 4. **Use `cosine` or `polynomial` LR scheduler**

Replace this:

```python
lr_scheduler_type="constant"
```

with:

```python
lr_scheduler_type="cosine"
```

or

```python
lr_scheduler_type="polynomial"
```

These give smoother convergence and can **reduce overfitting** and improve F1 scores on small datasets.

---

## ‚úÖ 5. **Better Evaluation Metrics**

You‚Äôre using:

```python
eval_strategy="steps"
eval_steps=112
```

‚úîÔ∏è Good ‚Äî now make sure you're computing **accuracy, precision, recall, and macro-F1**:

```python
compute_metrics = sklearn-style metrics dict
```

If not already defined, use:

```python
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report

def compute_metrics(eval_pred):
    logits, labels = eval_pred
    preds = np.argmax(logits, axis=-1)
    return classification_report(labels, preds, output_dict=True)
```

---

## ‚úÖ 6. **Data Augmentation / Label Smoothing**

If your dataset is imbalanced:

* Use **back-translation**, synonym replacement, or paraphrasing to balance under-represented emotions.
* Add **label smoothing** to reduce overconfidence in softmax outputs.

---

## ‚úÖ 7. **Try `packing=True` for longer context**

If your sequences are short and many, enabling `packing=True` allows better GPU utilization and effective attention training.

---

## ‚úÖ 8. **Logits Bias & Output Filtering**

If model sometimes outputs irrelevant text or multiple labels, post-process generated tokens to:

* Limit to only 6 known emotion labels.
* Use forced decoding strategies or **generation constraints**.

---

## ‚úÖ 9. **Tune Learning Rate**

You're using `2e-4` ‚Äî this may be too aggressive depending on your dataset size.

üîÅ Try:

* `1e-4`
* `5e-5`

Use **learning rate sweeps** to find best fit.

---

## ‚úÖ 10. **Eval on Text Prompts Instead of Tokens**

If you're prompting with instructions, but evaluating purely on token-level classification, **mismatch occurs**.

Instead, compare the **generated output string** directly to the ground-truth emotion labels.
