Thanks for sharing your setup. You're already using a solid base for fine-tuning Gemma-3-1B-it on emotion classification with LoRA. To improve performance further, especially for low-resource or complex emotion tasks, consider the following **strategic upgrades** across key areas:

---

## ‚úÖ 1. **Refine LoRA Configuration**

Your current config:

```python
target_modules="all-linear"
```

This may adapt too many layers indiscriminately. For **task-specific efficiency and better generalization**, try more **focused target modules**, like:

```python
target_modules=["q_proj", "v_proj", "o_proj", "gate_proj"]
```

Why?

* These layers are crucial for attention and MLP computations.
* Including `gate_proj` can help learn fine emotional nuances.

Also test:

* Lower `r` values like `r=16` or `32` to avoid overfitting (especially on smaller datasets).
* Use `fan_in_fan_out=True` if the model uses transposed weights (verify with model internals).

---

## ‚úÖ 2. **Instruction Template Quality**

Emotion classification benefits greatly from **prompt clarity** and **example richness**.

Improve your prompt structure:

```text
Instruction: Classify the emotion in the following text. 
Choose from: happy, sad, anger, fear, disgust, surprise.

Text: {sentence}

Answer:
```

Then expect the model to output the **label only** (`"happy"`, `"sad"` etc.).

üîÅ Use `add_special_tokens=True` during tokenization to help with structured prompt understanding.

---

## ‚úÖ 3. **Batching and Accumulation**

Your effective batch size is:

```python
batch_size = 1 * 8 = 8
```

üëâ **Try increasing batch size** if memory allows (e.g., `per_device_train_batch_size=2`), or increase `gradient_accumulation_steps` to 16.

This stabilizes training and helps generalization on classification tasks.

---

## ‚úÖ 4. **Use `cosine` or `polynomial` LR scheduler**

Replace this:

```python
lr_scheduler_type="constant"
```

with:

```python
lr_scheduler_type="cosine"
```

or

```python
lr_scheduler_type="polynomial"
```

These give smoother convergence and can **reduce overfitting** and improve F1 scores on small datasets.

---

## ‚úÖ 5. **Better Evaluation Metrics**

You‚Äôre using:

```python
eval_strategy="steps"
eval_steps=112
```

‚úîÔ∏è Good ‚Äî now make sure you're computing **accuracy, precision, recall, and macro-F1**:

```python
compute_metrics = sklearn-style metrics dict
```

If not already defined, use:

```python
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report

def compute_metrics(eval_pred):
    logits, labels = eval_pred
    preds = np.argmax(logits, axis=-1)
    return classification_report(labels, preds, output_dict=True)
```

---

## ‚úÖ 6. **Data Augmentation / Label Smoothing**

If your dataset is imbalanced:

* Use **back-translation**, synonym replacement, or paraphrasing to balance under-represented emotions.
* Add **label smoothing** to reduce overconfidence in softmax outputs.

---

## ‚úÖ 7. **Try `packing=True` for longer context**

If your sequences are short and many, enabling `packing=True` allows better GPU utilization and effective attention training.

---

## ‚úÖ 8. **Logits Bias & Output Filtering**

If model sometimes outputs irrelevant text or multiple labels, post-process generated tokens to:

* Limit to only 6 known emotion labels.
* Use forced decoding strategies or **generation constraints**.

---

## ‚úÖ 9. **Tune Learning Rate**

You're using `2e-4` ‚Äî this may be too aggressive depending on your dataset size.

üîÅ Try:

* `1e-4`
* `5e-5`

Use **learning rate sweeps** to find best fit.

---

## ‚úÖ 10. **Eval on Text Prompts Instead of Tokens**

If you're prompting with instructions, but evaluating purely on token-level classification, **mismatch occurs**.

Instead, compare the **generated output string** directly to the ground-truth emotion labels.

Would you like a modified version of your `LoraConfig` and `SFTConfig` to reflect these improvements directly?



Your training setup looks solid, with several well-considered configurations like LoRA fine-tuning, fused optimizers, mixed-precision, and gradient checkpointing. But there are **several areas you could further tune or revise to improve model performance**, depending on what ‚Äúperformance‚Äù means for your use case (e.g., accuracy, loss, generalization, training speed, memory efficiency).

Here‚Äôs a breakdown of what you‚Äôre already doing well, and what **could be improved**:

---

## ‚úÖ Already Optimized Elements

### 1. **LoRA Config (`peft_config`)**

* `lora_alpha=64`, `r=32`: Good capacity; higher `r` and `alpha` increase learning capacity of the adapters.
* `lora_dropout=0.05`: Helps regularization, prevents overfitting.
* `target_modules='all-linear'`: Broad adaptation; ensures wide adaptation of transformer internals.

### 2. **Training Arguments**

* `gradient_checkpointing=True`: Saves memory.
* `adamw_torch_fused`: Excellent choice for speed on modern GPUs.
* `fp16/bf16`: Speeds up training while reducing memory (assuming hardware supports it).
* `lr_scheduler_type="cosine"`: Smooth learning rate decay.

---

## üîß Potential Improvements

### **1. Learning Rate Tuning**

* `learning_rate=4e-4` is relatively high, especially for fine-tuning. Try:

  * Lower: `1e-4` or `5e-5` for stability
  * **Learning rate sweep**: Try multiple values to find optimum

### **2. Weight Decay**

* `weight_decay=0.001` is fine, but tuning this can help generalization.

  * Try `0.01` or even `0.0` (especially with adapters like LoRA)

### **3. Increase `gradient_accumulation_steps` (if possible)**

* You're using `batch_size=2` and `grad_accumulation=8` ‚áí effective batch size = 16

  * Try **increasing to 32 or 64**, if memory allows
  * Larger effective batch sizes can stabilize training, especially with Adam

### **4. Add Evaluation Metrics**

* Currently, `eval_strategy="steps"` and `eval_dataset=eval_data`, but no explicit metrics.

  * Add `compute_metrics` to `SFTTrainer`, e.g., accuracy, perplexity, or task-specific score
  * Helps monitor real improvement

### **5. Enable `group_by_length=True`**

* Currently `group_by_length=False`

  * If your data has variable lengths, **grouping by length improves efficiency and convergence**
  * Especially helpful for long sequence causal LM

### **6. Use Packing (Optional)**

* `packing=False`: This leaves a lot of padding

  * Set to `True` **if your sequences are mostly short** and you're using a tokenizer like `LlamaTokenizer` or `GPT2Tokenizer`
  * Increases token-level efficiency

### **7. Warmup Strategy**

* `warmup_ratio=0.03`: Reasonable, but you can:

  * Use absolute `warmup_steps` if you know total steps
  * Try increasing to `0.1` if loss spikes at start

### **8. Validation Strategy**

* `eval_steps=112` might be infrequent depending on total steps.

  * Tune based on training speed and overfitting rate

### **9. LoRA Target Modules Granularity**

* `target_modules='all-linear'` is broad

  * If you‚Äôre using HuggingFace transformer models, specifying something like:

    ```python
    target_modules=["q_proj", "v_proj"]
    ```

    is often more **memory-efficient** and just as effective.

---

## üß™ Advanced (Optional)

### üîÅ Try `flash-attn` or `xformers`

* If you're using a supported model (like LLaMA), these can **dramatically speed up training** and reduce memory use.

### üß© Try model.eval() during eval steps

* Helps prevent memory leaks if eval layers still use dropout etc.
